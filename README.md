# Projects
## Game Engine

<!-- Ideas:
        - One with OpenGL/Vulkan where you type and a 3d version of it is on the screen
            as you type (Maybe only takes a couple seconds worth of text?). Camera also
            moves around smoothly (Maybe more erratically the faster you type?). Maybe 
            instead of flat objects, use particles and trails to fill in the space?
        - A website that will also serve as the github pages webpage to host my portfolio projects.

    Should do: If my skills improved and is warrented/beneficial enough, recreate previous
      from the ground up and provide links and a quick (no more than a couple sentances) of what
      the previous versions are about. Also include what is new/different/improved about
      the current up to date version.
