## Projects
<!-- Ideas:
        - One with OpenGL/Vulkan where you type and a 3d version of it is on the screen
            as you type (Maybe only takes a couple seconds worth of text?). Camera also
            moves around smoothly (Maybe more erratically the faster you type?). Maybe 
            instead of flat objects, use particles and trails to fill in the space?
