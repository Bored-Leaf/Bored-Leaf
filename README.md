Hello. I'm a software developer building a custom game engine

# Interests
- Systems programming
- OS development (Eventually)
- Graphics APIs
- Game Engines

# [Uni based projects](https://github.com/Bored-Leaf/Uni-Projects)
A repo containing projects and assignments I made in uni

<!--
Update linkedIn and Github to mention the systems I've built.
For example:
  - Built modular systems for rendering, input and audio.
  - Implemented custom memory management and job system.
  - Handled low-latency resource streaming and profiling.

**FOR EACH PROJECT MAKE SURE TO PUT STUFF IN THE README.TXT, STUFF LIKE:** 
  - Goal/Purpurse of project*
  - *Features*
  - *Tech Stack*
    - *I implemented X using framework Y because.*
  - * What the project showcases *
  - *etc.*

# Personal Projects
## Current WIP Projects:
### Big
[Bored-Leaf-Engine]() - Modular 3D game engine with performance, modularity and robustness as core design goals. Using C++, SDL3, OpenGL (Eventually Vulkan), and FMOD
### Medium
[Intrument playback Visualiser]() - Displays the frequencies/spectrogram/sound wave displacement of a currently played instrument through an audio interface.
### Small
[Data Structure Simulations]() - Personal learning mini-projects creating data structures in C/C++.
<!-- Ideas:
        - A website that will also serve as the github pages webpage to host my personal portfolio projects.

        Graphics based:
          - visualiser of instrument playback. Like for example displaying the 
          frequencies/spectrogram/sound wave displacement of an instrument played through 
          an audio interface

        Simulation based:
          - Maybe simulation engine?
          - Engine simulation including sound, RPM, speed, oil pressure, fuel usage ,etc.
            
        

    Should do: If my skills improved and is warrented/beneficial enough, recreate previous
      from the ground up and provide links and a quick (no more than a couple sentances) of what
      the previous versions are about. Also include what is new/different/improved about
      the current up to date version.

## Finished Projects:
Most of these are for me to more easily search for them
