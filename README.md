Hello. I'm a software developer building a custom game engine

# Interests
- Systems programming
- OS development (Eventually)
- Graphics APIs
- Game Engines

# [Uni based projects](https://github.com/Bored-Leaf/Uni-Projects)
A repo containing projects and assignments I made in uni

# Personal Projects
- [Bored-Leaf-Engine]() - Modular 2D game engine with performance, modularity and robustness as core design goals. Using C++, SDL3, OpenGL (Eventually Vulkan), and FMOD.
<!--
Update linkedIn and Github to mention the systems I've built.
For example:
  - Built modular systems for rendering, input and audio.
  - Implemented custom memory management and job system.
  - Handled low-latency resource streaming and profiling.

**FOR EACH PROJECT MAKE SURE TO PUT STUFF IN THE README.TXT, STUFF LIKE:** 
  - Goal/Purpurse of project*
  - *Features*
  - *Tech Stack*
    - *I implemented X using framework Y because.*
  - * What the project showcases *
  - *etc.*

-->
- [Data Structure Simulations]() - Personal learning mini-projects creating data structures in C++.

<!-- Ideas:
        - A website that will also serve as the github pages webpage to host my personal portfolio projects.

        Graphics based:
          - One with OpenGL/Vulkan where you type and a 3d version of it is on the screen
              as you type (Maybe only takes a couple seconds worth of text?). Camera also
              moves around smoothly (Maybe more erratically the faster you type?). Maybe 
              instead of flat objects, use particles and trails to fill in the space?

        Simulation based:
          - Maybe simulation engine?
          - Engine simulation including sound, RPM, speed, oil pressure, fuel usage ,etc.
            
        

    Should do: If my skills improved and is warrented/beneficial enough, recreate previous
      from the ground up and provide links and a quick (no more than a couple sentances) of what
      the previous versions are about. Also include what is new/different/improved about
      the current up to date version.
